/**
 All of the routes for the Vision UI Dashboard React are added here,
 You can add a new route, customize the routes and delete the routes here.

 Once you add a new route on this file it will be visible automatically on
 the Sidenav.

 For adding a new route you can follow the existing routes in the routes array.
 1. The `type` key with the `collapse` value is used for a route.
 2. The `type` key with the `title` value is used for a title inside the Sidenav.
 3. The `type` key with the `divider` value is used for a divider between Sidenav items.
 4. The `name` key is used for the name of the route on the Sidenav.
 5. The `key` key is used for the key of the route (It will help you with the key prop inside a loop).
 6. The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the Sidenav, you have to add a node.
 7. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the Sidenav that has other routes
 inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.
 8. The `route` key is used to store the route location which is used for the react router.
 9. The `href` key is used to store the external links location.
 10. The `title` key is only for the item with the type of `title` and its used for the title text on the Sidenav.
 10. The `component` key is used to store the component of its route.
